    <h1>Electronics For Mechanical Engineers syllabus</h1>
    <section>
    <p>ME 93, Special Topics: Electronics for Mechanical Engineers, Section 02, class number 23262</p>
    <p>You can find this document and a bunch of other information at <a href="http://lctronics.org">lctronics.org</a>. If the link doesn't work, you're probably using the paper version.</p>
    <h2>Course description</h2>
    <p>A project-based hands-on electronics boot camp, focusing on the design and fabrication of printed circuit boards and interfacing with microcontrollers from the Arduino and Raspberry Pi families. </p>
    <h2>Course goals</h2>
    <p>The goal of Electronics for Mechanical Engineers is to force students to gain experience with the practical challenges of building electrical hardware. Acting as a counterbalance to the largely theory-heavy curriculum of the modern university, the course makes students work in teams with their mostly inexperienced peers, where they argue, burn out chips, and struggle with lightly documented hardware. They face engineering failure and have to recover to succeed.</p>
    <h2>Lecturer</h2>
    <p>Brandon Stafford, brandon.stafford@tufts.edu</p>
    <p>I check email in the morning.</p>
    <h2>Textbooks</h2>
    <p>There will be no textbook for the class. Instead, you will be asked to buy two small microcontrollers and a few accessories.
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <p>While there may occasionally be readings or other tasks asked of you, the majority of your effort in this class will be on project work. The class will culminate in a final project covering the 5 weeks after spring break.</p>
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>There will be no quizzes or exams. Grades will be based on your project work.</p>
    <p>Did you build something? Did it work? Was it finely crafted? Did you work well with your teammates?</p>
    <h2>No electronics</h2>
    <p>Generally, I need too much of your attention to allow distractions like cell phones and laptops in class. There will be rare exceptions in class, like when we're using computers as tools for designing the stuff we're making.</p>
    <h2>Lectures</h2>
    <p>Tu, Th 10:30-11:45 in <a href="http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/#fid=205"></a>, the Science and Engineering Complex, 200 College Avenue, 1st floor, <a href="http://engineering.tufts.edu/computing/facilities/blake">Room 22, also called "Blake-Perlman Computational Studio" or "that room next to the cafe in the SEC."</a></p>
    <p>Project work will take place in Blake, and in the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/designlab/">Design Lab</a>, the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/mechatronics/">Mechatronics Zone</a>, and the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/instrumentation/">Instrumentation Lab</a>, the last few of which are in <a href="http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/#fid=m008">Bray Lab</a>.</p>
