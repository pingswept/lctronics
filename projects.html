<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>Final project: Build a smart sensor/actuator system.</h2>
<p>Your team's job is to build a smart sensor that controls a smart actuator over the internet.</p>
<h3>System requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It should consist of at least one sensor and at least one actuator that are not attached to each other.</li>
	<li>The sensor and actuator should communicate with each other through the internet.</li>
	<li>The system should do something beautiful, useful, or both, without physical intervention or control signals from you.</li>
	<li>The system should be enclosed and immune to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Articulated-Finger-accessibility-electrical-standards/dp/B0716YYXN2">test finger probe</a>, like that used in UL/IEC 60950-1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sensor requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It should sense something.</li>
	<li>The sensor hardware should process the raw sensor data such that it can report instantaneous readings, as well as an average value over the 5 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes, via HTTP. (You can change the exact details of this depending on your sensor; the intent is that it should report useful information beyond the raw signal.)</li>
	<li>It should run without a connection to a laptop. Batteries or a wall plug are okay.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actuator requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It should physically move in response to your sensor.</li>
	<li>Including LEDs, displays, or sound is also good, but not required.</li>
	<li>It should query your sensor via HTTP.</li>
	<li>It should report log data about its motion via HTTP at http://its.ip.address/log</li>
	<li>It should run without a connection to a laptop. Batteries or a wall plug are okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is probably wise to have one of you manage the sensor and one of you manage the actuator, you are both responsible for the entire system. Saying, "Well, my side works; it's his side that doesn't work," is the same as saying, "I have failed to get half of the project working." Both sides are your sides.</p>
<p><b>Due date: Thursday, April 26, 10:30 AM</b> (last class of the semester)</p>

<h2>Project #3: Build a microcontroller-based game</h2>
<p>Your task, as described in some detail in class, is to build a game with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is controlled by a microcontroller like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi</li>
	<li>It is at least sort of fun to play. A blinking LED is not a game.</li>
	<li>(It does not need to have a custom PCB, but it can if you want. If it has a custom PCB, you must make a working prototype first.)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Due date: Thursday, March 15, 10:30 AM</b> (last class before spring break)</p>
<p><b>Due date for PCB submission, if you're making one: Friday, March 16, 4 PM</b></p>
<p>If you need parts, please let me know as soon as you can.</p>
<p>If you would like to include a display as part of your game, please use the SPI OLED displays that I will hand out in class on Tuesday, March 6. (You can use a different display if you really want to; I just don't want to help debug 23 different displays for no reason.)</p>

<h2>Project #2: Build a DC motor controller run by a microcontroller</h2>
<p>Your task, as described in some detail in class, is to build a DC motor controller with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It consists of a PCB that connects to a microcontroller (say, an Arduino)</li>
	<li>It accepts power from a 2.1 x 5.5 mm plug from a 12 V wall adapter</li>
	<li>It has a power LED that lights up when motor power is available</li>
	<li>It can make a DC motor spin in both directions.</li>
	<li>It can deliver 5 amps continuously. (This means extra wide traces in some places, and note that the Arduino Vin pin can only handle around 1 A, so drawing power through the Arduino won't work.)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Due date (for PCB submission): Tuesday, February 20, 10:30 AM</b></p>
<p>When your design is ready, you should <a href="https://oshpark.com/">submit it to the fabricator</a>, OSH Park. It will cost you around $10. After you submit it, forward your order confirmation to brandon.stafford@tufts.edu. That will serve as proof that you submitted your project on time.</p>
<h3>More details for project #2</h3>
<p>If you want, you can try something more ambitious than what is described above. Upgrades that you might consider include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Adding LEDs that show which gates are active</li>
	<li>Adding a microcontroller onboard that can provide some level of smart behavior, like speed control or shoot-through prevention</li>
	<li>Using an integrated chip of your own selection rather than discrete MOSFETs</li>
	<li>Using surface-mount components (cool idea, but not for the power/motor connectors)</li>
	<li>Adding a low-current mode, where motor current can be supplied through the Arduino</li>
</ul>
<p>One other note: the green screw terminals that I offered you for the first project can handle 5 amps, so that would be a good choice for the motor connector.</p>
<h2>Project #1: Build a breadboard power supply</h2>
<p>The first project, as described in some detail in the first class, is to build a power supply with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It consists of a PCB that plugs directly in a breadboard</li>
	<li>It accepts power from a 2.1 x 5.5 mm plug from a 12 V wall adapter</li>
	<li>It emits 12 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V (at the same time).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Due date (for PCB submission): Tuesday, January 30, 10:30 AM</b></p>
<p>When your design is ready, you should <a href="https://oshpark.com/">submit it to the fabricator</a>, OSH Park. It will cost you around $10. After you submit it, forward your order confirmation to brandon.stafford@tufts.edu. That will serve as proof that you submitted your project on time.</p>
<h3>More details for project #1</h3>
<p>First of all, we're not trying to build anything revolutionary in this project. None of you have ever made a PCB before, so the point is to make something fairly simple to get comfortable with the process. (If you search Amazon for "breadboard power supply", you'll see that you can buy various versions of things like this, though none with the 12 V passthrough, so far as I'm aware.)</p>
<p>The image below shows the rough mechanical constraints for the PCB. You can make a board of whatever dimensions you want, but it needs to plug into the breadboard, hence the pin location dimensions.</p>
<p><img src="img/breadboard-supply-mechanical-design.png"></p>
<p>In the first class, I'll hand out all the <a href="components.html">components</a> you'll need to build a prototype of your power supply on a breadboard. You can then reuse the components on your PCB.</p>
<p>To improve heat dissipation, you will want to use your PCB as a heatsink for the regulators. Dominic has made a <a href="to-220-horizontal-footprint.kicad_mod">KiCAD PCB footprint for the TO-220 package</a> to help with that. You should put it into a folder called some-name.pretty. (The ending .pretty is what matters.)</p>
<p>Put that folder in C:\Program Files\KiCad\share\kicad\modules on Windows or /Library/Application Support/kicad/modules on MacOS. Then, you can add that library to Kicad using Preferences > Footprint Libraries in the footprint association window.</p>
<p><b>Note that the pins on the LM7805 and the LM1117 regulators are not in the same order!</b></p>
