<h1>Designing printed circuit boards</h1>
<h2>PCB manufacturing process</h2>
<p><img src="img/pcb-fabrication-layers.jpg"></p>
<h2>What software?</h2>
<p>You should use <a href="https://kicad-pcb.org">Kicad</a>. It's free and open source, which means that once you learn to use it, you can make PCBs as long as you have a computer. You could also try Eagle, which might be a little easier to use, but it requires a subscription if you want to make a board bigger than this chocolate bar that I'm eating. I've designed a few boards in Eagle; neither Kicad nor Eagle is great (though both are improving fairly quickly after a decade or so of stagnation). You could also try a browser-based program like <a href="https://upverter.com">Upverter</a>, but if they shut down their servers, your designs are gone.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel any better, expensive PCB design software, like <a href="http://altium.com">Altium Designer</a>, is also pretty lousy. (I think the general problem the industry is facing is that electrical engineers are a relatively small ppopulation, and they're pretty good at figuring out how to use bad software.)</p>
<h2>Learning Kicad</h2>
<p>Here's a rough summary of how to use Kicad.</p>
<ol>
	<li>(If you're using a laptop with a trackpad, plug in a real mouse.)</li>
	<li>Make a new project.</li>
	<li>Add components to the schematic file.</li>
	<li>Connect the components together in the schematic.</li>
	<li>Associate a footprint with each component.</li>
	<li>Generate a netlist from the schematic.</li>
	<li>Read the netlist into the PCB file.</li>
	<li>Make a mechanical outline of the PCB on the Edge.Cuts layer.</li>
	<li>Roughly arrange the parts the way you want them.</li>
	<li>Place mechanically critical components.</li>
	<li>Place the rest of the components and route traces between everything.</li>
	<li>Run a design rule check (DRC).</li>
	<li>Repeat cycle: schematic/footprints -> gen. netlist -> read netlist -> tweak layout -> run DRC</li>
    <li>Submit .kicad_pcb file to OSH Park (or possibly generate Gerber files for another manufacturer).</li>
</ol>
