    <h1>How to behave in college</h1>
    <section>
    <h2>What do we call you?</h2>
    <p>For most teachers in college, the conventional answer is "Professor [LAST NAME]" or "Doctor [LAST NAME]." If the teacher's name were Albus Dumbledore, you would call them "Doctor Dumbledore," "Professor Dumbledore," or just "Professor" for short. In an email, you might write "Dr. Dumbledore."</p>
    <p>For me in particular, we have a bit of an awkward situation to deal with. Tufts has given me the title "Lecturer," not "Professor," and I'd feel like a bit of a fraud asking you to call me by a higher rank than I am, so "Professor" is out. Also, I don't have a doctorate degree (a Ph.D.), so "Doctor" is out as well. This leaves us with a few options.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mr. Stafford</li>
        <li>Brandon</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The good news is that you get to pick. As I have repeatedly told my 3-year-old daughter, I don't care what words you use; I do care about the tone of your voice. If you were to call me, "PROFESSOR STAFFORD!" in the same tone that my daughter uses for, "I WILL NEVER NEVER TAKE A DEEP BREATH AGAIN!", I would be irritated with you, even though you chose respectful words. On the other hand, people have been calling me "Brandon" every day for the last 4 decades, so it feels fine to me.</p>
    <h2>Does this really matter?</h2>
    <p>The truth is that I don't really care what you call me, and I will probably pretend not to be irritated with you even if I feel irritated inside. This is called presenting a professional persona, and it's one of the skills that you need to learn to be a good engineer.</p>
    <h2>Your engineering persona</h2>
    <p>One of the major skills of an engineer is working collaboratively in teams. Over time, you should cultivate a persona that you adopt when you are engaged in engineering.</p>
    <p>Great engineers are particularly good at giving engineering criticism that makes you feel enlightened, rather than beaten down. Here are some suggestions to help you get started.</p>
    <p><i>Criticize the design, not the person.</i> When you feel criticized, check whether the target might be the design rather than you. You might adopt Jon Postel's Robustness Principle, from section 1.2.2 of <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt">the IETF's RFC1122</a>, "Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send."</p>
    <p>A few examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>❤ "I'm worried this part won't be strong enough." ❤</li>
        <li>⚠ "You're out of your mind! This will never work!" ⚠</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Be specific in your criticism.</i> Try to anticipate failures and describe failure modes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>❤ "I'm worried the wood will slide under the tape, and then the upper deck will collapse." ❤</li>
        <li>⚠ "This design is bad. So bad. It just is." ⚠</li>
    </ul>
