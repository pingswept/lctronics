<h1>Electronics for Mechanical Engineers</h1>
<p><i>Electronics for Mechanical Engineers</i> is a class developed by Brandon Stafford, first taught in the spring of 2018 at Tufts University.</p>
<h2>More information</h2>
<p><a href="syllabus.html">Syllabus</a>, which is also the handout from the first day of class</p>
<p>The point of the class is to provide you with hands-on experience building and debugging electronics, to complement the theory that you learned in ES3 and ES4. To that end, the class is based around a series of projects, detailed on the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.</p>

<h3>Notes from classes</h3>
    <p>There will be notes here eventually.</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet/">Wired's description of the discovery of Stuxnet</a>, probably the world's first state-sponsored cyberweapon
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"The fact that Stuxnet was injecting commands into the PLC and masking that it was doing so was evidence that it was designed, not for espionage as everyone had believed, but for physical sabotage. The researchers were stunned. It was the first time anyone had seen digital code in the wild being used to physically destroy something in the real world.</p>
<p>The malware would sit quietly on the system doing reconnaissance for about two weeks, then launch its attack swiftly and quietly, increasing the frequency of the converters to 1,410Hz for 15 minutes, before restoring them to a normal frequency of 1,064Hz. The frequency would remain at this level for 27 days, before Stuxnet would kick in again and drop the frequency down to 2Hz for 50 minutes."</p>
