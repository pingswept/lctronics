<h1>How To Make Stuff</h1>
<p><i>How To Make Stuff</i> is a class developed by Brandon Stafford. First taught in the fall of 2016 at Tufts University, it's coming back for a second year at Tufts. The course is said to be, in the modern vernacular, "lit."</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"The fact that Stuxnet was injecting commands into the PLC and masking that it was doing so was evidence that it was designed, not for espionage as everyone had believed, but for physical sabotage. The researchers were stunned. It was the first time anyone had seen digital code in the wild being used to physically destroy something in the real world.</p>
<p>The malware would sit quietly on the system doing reconnaissance for about two weeks, then launch its attack swiftly and quietly, increasing the frequency of the converters to 1,410Hz for 15 minutes, before restoring them to a normal frequency of 1,064Hz. The frequency would remain at this level for 27 days, before Stuxnet would kick in again and drop the frequency down to 2Hz for 50 minutes."</p>
