<h1>Connectors</h1>
<p>For reasons that I don't understand, I am fascinated by connectors (and fasteners). Below is are notes on the connectors I have used most in my electrical engineering career. To keep the list finite, I left out connectors that I haven't actually used, even if they are common. A good example would be Apple's Lightning connector-- I see them around on iPhones, but I've never designed an iPhone, so they're dead to me.</p>

    <h2>RJ45</h2>
    <p>These are the 8-pin connectors used for Ethernet; they are a mechanical marvel. When you crimp an RJ45 connector onto the end of a piece of cable, the crimping tool forces 8 small gold-plated wedges down into the 8 conductors in the cable. The wedges pierce the insulation and spear into the copper in the middle. At the same time, the crimping tool buckles a plastic bar in the connector housing that clamps down on the cable sleeve to provide "strain relief," i.e. it connects the outer sheath of the cable to the connector, so that when you yank on it, the conductors don't take the mechanical load. Once the crimping is done, the tops of the 8 wedges are the contact points that mate with 8 spring-loaded bars in the female receptacle so current can flow. I think these are my favorite connectors.</p>
    <h2>RJ11</h2>
    <p>Like RJ45, but 4 or 6 conductors. In the dull, lifeless era before cellular telephony, we'd call these phone cables.</p>
    <h2>Anderson</h2>
    <p>"Anderson connectors" are high-current connectors used on electric vehicles. The company, owned by the Anderson Carbolon Group, now a subsidiary of Ideal Industries, actually makes a huge variety of connectors. Their main office in Sterling, MA (just south of Leominster) used to have a great answering machine message with a strong Boston accent: "You've reached the Andahson-Cahbolon Group." Anyway, if you hear someone talking about an Anderson connector, they probably mean the SBE series-- they're enormous connectors with two conductors that are used to handle large currents from batteries to electric motors. For smaller stuff, their PowerPole connectors are also popular; they're cool because you can assemble them into color-coded arrays.</p>
    <h2>XT60</h2>
    <p>Usually used on battery packs for radio-controlled cars. These usually attach to wire in the range of 10-14 AWG, which makes them frustrating to solder-- the heat tends to escape down the fat wire before the solder melts. You'll want to heatshrink to cover the solder cups when you're done. The nice floppy wire you want for battery packs is called "sih2cone wire" because the insulation contains sih2cone.</p>
    <h2>3.5 mm jack</h2>
    <h2>2.54 mm headers</h2>
    <h2>4 mm bullet</h2>
    <h2>Amphenol</h2>
    <h2>Molex</h2>
    <h2>NEMA</h2>
    <h2>USB</h2>
    <h2>DB-9</h2>
    <h2>HDMI</h2>
    <h2>JST</h2>
    <h2>RCA jack</h2>
    <h2>Screw terminals, or terminal blocks</h2>
    <h2>IDC connectors</h2>
    <h2>DC barrel jack</h2>
    <h2>ZIF socket</h2>
    <h2>DMX or XLR</h2>
    <h2>BNC</h2>
    <p>BNC connectors use coaxial cables, which have an interesting property. A changing magnetic field induces a voltage in a loop of wire. A twisted pair of wires reduces the voltage induced by making many small loops of alternating polarity, such that the voltage from one small loop is canceled out by the adjacent loop. When used between two instruments enclosed in metal boxes, a coaxial cable takes this one step farther by enclosing the signal conductor entirely in an external ground conductor, so there is no way for a changing magnetic field to pierce the loop. That's why you see BNC connectors on oscilloscopes.</p>
    <h2>SMA</h2>
    <p>Like a tiny BNC connector, used for antennas.</p>
    <h2>Lemo</h2>
    <p>Very awesome, very expensive connectors made in Switzerland. Mostly circular, waterproof, high-pole count. There's some kind of weird feud going on between <a href="https://www.lemo.com">Lemo</a> and <a href="https://fischerconnectors.com">Fischer</a>. Both are high-end connector companies founded in Switzerland in the 1940's or 50's that sold push-pull connector designs in the 60's. Lemo's website says, <a href="https://www.lemo.com/en/about-lemo/history">"Originally a manufacturer of contacts in noble and rare metals, the company took a major step forward in 1957 with the introduction of the push-pull self-latching connector."</a> Fischer's says, <a href="https://www.fischerconnectors.com/us/en/history">"In 1962 the company filed an international patent for its push-pull locking system."</a> I've never used Fischer connectors, but I'm not saying I wouldn't.</p>
    <h2>Fischer</h2>
    <p>See Lemo Connectors, above.</p>
    <h2>Samtec</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.samtec.com/">Samtec</a> is not a connector, but a company that makes a gigantic range of small, awesome connectors. Their customer service and documentation are unusually good and they will send you sample connectors for free. I always try them first because dealing with Molex, Amphenol, and the like, is so irritating.</p>
